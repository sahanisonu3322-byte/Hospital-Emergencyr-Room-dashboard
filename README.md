# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard | Healthcare Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **interactive Hospital Emergency Room dashboard** to analyze **patient flow, emergency room performance, and operational efficiency** using healthcare data analytics techniques.

The dashboard supports **data-driven decision-making** by visualizing key hospital emergency metrics through structured KPIs and trend analysis.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze **patient admission status** (admitted vs. not admitted)
- Evaluate **patient demographics** (age group and gender analysis)
- Measure **timeliness of care** (patients seen within 30 minutes)
- Identify **high-volume department referrals**
- Monitor **emergency room performance metrics**

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total number of emergency room patients
- Average patient wait time
- Patient satisfaction score
- Admission rate analysis
- Timeliness percentage (SLA compliance)
